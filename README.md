## Project Details

### Challenge

The challenge was to replicate the QR code component design as closely as possible using HTML and CSS, focusing on implementing the design details from provided static JPG files.

### Design Files

The design files for both mobile and desktop versions are located in the `/design` folder. Assets necessary for the project are in the `/images` folder, while style guide details are available in `style-guide.md`.

## Building the Project

### Process

The project was initiated as a public repository on GitHub to facilitate code sharing and collaboration. It was structured using HTML5 markup and styled using CSS custom properties. The workflow involved:

1. Understanding the design layout from the provided files.
2. Writing structured HTML content before adding styles.
3. Implementing base styles for fonts, sizes, and content layout.
4. Step-by-step styling from top to bottom, ensuring completion of each section before moving forward.

### Tools Used

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### Learnings

The primary learning from this project was deploying the website for free, along with reinforcing HTML and CSS skills. Here are snippets of code I found noteworthy:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Areas for Improvement

Continued focus on refining HTML/CSS skills and exploring more advanced concepts in future projects.
